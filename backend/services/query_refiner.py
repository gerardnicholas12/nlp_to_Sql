Chatbot / query-refinement logic.

This module is intentionally kept separate from nlp_to_sql.py. It does NOT
re-run the NLP parser. Instead it:
  1. Parses the previously-generated SQL string back into a small structured
     dict (table / select columns / where conditions / group by / having /
     order by / limit) using regex.
  2. Applies rule-based edits to that dict based on the user's free-text
     feedback, reusing the same vocabulary dictionaries as nlp_to_sql.py
     (TABLE_MAP, COLUMN_MAP, CITIES, DEPARTMENTS, GENDERS, SORT_DIRECTION_MAP)
     so "Bangalore", "HR", "descending", etc. are recognised consistently.
     It also reuses nlp_to_sql.py's words_to_numbers() and
     merge_comparison_phrases() helpers, so English number words ("two",
     "one hundred") and >=/<= phrasings ("at least", "2 or more") are
     understood the same way here as in the main NLP parser.
  3. Rebuilds a new SQL string from the edited dict.

Scope / known limitation: only "simple" SELECT ... FROM <table> [WHERE ...]
[GROUP BY ...] [HAVING ...] [ORDER BY ...] [LIMIT ...] queries can be
refined this way. If the previous SQL contains a JOIN, UNION, EXISTS,
CASE, or a subquery, refinement is declined and the user is asked to
rephrase their original question instead - those query shapes are complex
enough that blind text-editing of the SQL string would be unsafe.
